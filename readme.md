# AclPlus

## Introduction
AclPlus aims to be a viable alternative to those who are not comfortable with
CakePHPs built in AclComponent. And who knows, I may even throw a couple of things
CakeAcl can't do without a lot of hacking. ;)

## Goals
 * Distributed as a Plugin.
 * Can be used for row-level as well as action-by-action access control.
 * When finding an ACO that is not logged in the ACO table add a new record to help
   maintain the ACO table.
 * Can pick and choose which part of the authentication plugin/components you want to use.
 * Additional configuration such as action maps and allowed actions are not done in
   the Controller but in a configuration file loaded by the bootstrap.
 * Plenty of Auto Magic, but confined to doing it's job. i.e. checking that an ARO
   has access to an ACO, no redirecting or login extras built in.
 * Can use the standard Cake AclBehaviour and table layout generated by the cake console, may
   have to include one of the newer versions of AclBehaviour to allow an Aro to also be
   and Aco.
 * Can be used with any means of Authentication, distributed with Authsome but can easily work
   with Cake Auth.
 * Effective use of caching and reducing database queries wherever possible.
 * Provide some static methods for easy use outside of the controller, for instance
   in the AppHelper when checking a logged in user has access to a link before outputing
   to the view.

## Additional Information
 * PHP5
 * Should work with Cake1.2 but untested.

## Current Features
 * Provides a single method to check if a user has access to the current controller/action combination.
 * Created a simple plugin bootstrap which in the future should be loaded in app/config/bootstrap.php,
   though not needed right now.

## Todo
 * Lots

## Issues
 * Lots

## Usage Example

### Using Authsome

    class AppController extends Controller
    {

        public function beforeFilter() {
            $this->AclPlus->check('User', Authsome::get());
        }

    }

### Using CakePHP Auth

    class AppController extends Controller
    {

        public function beforeFilter() {
            $this->AclPlus->check('User', $this->Auth->user('id'));
        }

    }
